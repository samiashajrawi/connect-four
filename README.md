# connect-four
Building a Connect Four game using D3.js and React involves leveraging D3 for creating the SVG-based grid and using React to manage the game state and interactivity.

# Create the Game Board
Connect Four has a 7x6 grid. Youâ€™ll use D3.js to create this grid, and React will handle the logic for dropping discs into the columns.

# Basic Components
Create the following components:

- GameBoard: This will handle the grid and gameplay.
- Cell: Each cell of the grid.
- Disc: Represents each player's move (Red or Yellow).
